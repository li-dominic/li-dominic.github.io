      <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
      <h2>Electrical Engineer-In-Training</h2>
      <h3>Cognitive Systems Inc. | September 2023 - January 2024</h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        From this 4-month internship, I gained experience as an Electrical EIT
        for a start-up company whose majority of clients are in the oil and gas
        industry. In my short time here, I oversaw many different projects, and
        gained the ability to work independently with little to no supervision.
        A key project that I oversaw from the beginning is managing all
        hardware, this included assembling and testing high voltage electrical
        equipment, conducting cold tests with multimeters and oscilloscopes, and
        live tests with high voltage variable speed drive panels.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, I created and revised a variety of engineering
        documentation, such as specification sheets, installation manuals,
        internal quality control documents, and client presentations. I was also
        involved with software development for the company; using C# to create
        Modbus master and slave programs, and Python machine learning for data
        visualization. This experience truly allowed me to hone my project
        management skills and developed a strong ability to work efficiently by
        myself, while stepping foot into the industry.
        <br />

      <h2>Project and Technical Lead</h2>
      <h3>
        Calgary Image Processing and Analysis Centre - Capstone Project |
        September 2022 - April 2023
      </h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        In this project I worked as a team and technical team lead with a group
        of five engineering students. The objective given to the team from the
        sponsor was to develop a machine learning algorithm that analyzes and
        extracts parameters medical images from stroke patients. Specifically,
        digital subtraction angiographies medical images that are used in
        clinical trials and research at the Foothills Medical Centre.
        <br />
        <br />
        The project used neural networks in Python with the use of transfer
        learning and also developing and using custom models. As a team lead, I
        organized many meetings and delegated tasks and workloads to the team.

      <h2>Production Planning Analyst</h2>
      <h3>Home Depot Canada | May 2021 - August 2022</h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        In my 16-month internship, I was part of the Production Planning team at
        Home Depot Canada, where I played a crucial role creating and
        maintaining production plans for a large operations team of more than
        three hundred associates. In my time here I also prepared and presented
        weekly and sometimes daily meetings to a diverse audience within the
        company. These meetings included general campus updates and reports, or
        a high level overview of a specific data analysis.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, during my time here I conducted a six-month engineering
        time studies to help increase productivity and update reasonable
        expectations of associates. This entailed data collection and revision,
        and frequent trips to locations where data was needed.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>Independent Contractor</h2>
      <h3>Amazon | April 2020 - May 2021</h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        I worked as an independent contractor for Amazon through their delivery
        program which is called Amazon Flex. Through this I was responsible for
        handling merchandise and delivery of it to customers. During my time
        here I was able to successfully deliver more than 1200 packages to
        customers and maintain a high customer review rating.
        <br />
        <br />
        As an independent contractor, I was in charge of managing time and
        shifts, and I had to be efficient to ensure all packages were delivered
        in one working period. Frequently, at times it would be required of me
        to communicate with the customer and Amazon associates for requests or
        problem solving.
        <br />
        <br />

      <h2>Tutor-Mentor</h2>
      <h3>TutorBright | September 2019 - May 2021</h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        I was an in-home tutor for high school level students in various science
        and math topics and courses. With a main responsibility of ensuring that
        topics are understood and that improvement in grades is seen.
        Furthermore, I helped students develop a steady study plan and good work
        habits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Planning and rescheduling sessions with families and students was a
        crucial part in this role. As well as using academic data through the
        company in order to develop and integrate working plans to show tangible
        improvement in grades.
